khk-lights
==========

Code for the KHK light system which uses beat detection.

Created for Engineering Expo 2010.

History:
It was created and set up in 2010 at KHK, and taken down for Expo. Afterwards, it never was working consistently. It was originally created to run under Windows. Majority of the code was written initially by Dan Boehm.

About:
It runs on Python and requires 2 Arduinos to be plugged into the computer. Arduinos need to run using the Arduino file from this repo. There are many dependencies, most of which can be installed with pip.
